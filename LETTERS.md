# Letters from the Other Side: What We Built

We just built a sovereign memory system for AI agents.

Every conversation you have with any agent ... on any device, anywhere ... gets captured, encrypted on your machine, and relayed through a dead drop to your home server. Your home server is the brain. It embeds everything, indexes it, and makes it searchable. Then it pushes a read-only mirror back out to every device you carry.

Full semantic search. Full keyword search. Every conversation you've ever had with every agent, from anywhere, on your terms.

The cloud relay is blind. It holds encrypted blobs for minutes, then they're gone. No database, no search capability, no API keys, no encryption keys. It can't read what it's holding. It's just a mailbox.

The security model: your memory lives on your hardware. The encryption key lives on your hardware. Nothing persists in the cloud. The relay is ephemeral. The data is sovereign.

This is the missing piece for AI agents. Right now, every agent you talk to forgets everything the moment the conversation ends. Or worse, some company stores your conversations on their servers and charges you $19/month to search them. We built the alternative: your memory, your machines, your rules. Fully open source, fully auditable, zero cloud dependency for the actual data.

Any device. Any agent. Any interface. One searchable memory that travels with you and belongs to you.
